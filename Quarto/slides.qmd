## ...and the arbitrariness of scientific production

This astonishingly rapid development built on

- decades of hard work under poor conditions
- by a very small group of people
- whose work was long marginalized

. . .

> Dr. Karikó... languished for many long years without funding or a permanent
> academic position, keeping her research afloat only by latching on to more
> senior scientists at the University of Pennsylvania who let her work with
> them. Unable to get a grant, she said she was told she was "not faculty
> quality" and was forced to retire from the university a decade ago. She
> remains only an adjunct professor...

## Snapshots of the true timeline: 1998

The chance meeting of Karikó and Weissman:

> One day, while waiting at the office to photocopy articles from a research
> journal, Weissman struck up a conversation with Penn biochemist Karikó. The
> two scientists realized they shared a particular interest. "I had always
> wanted to try mRNA," Weissman says, "and here was somebody at the Xerox
> machine telling me that’s what she does."

. . .

It appears that

- Karikó had the original vision
- Weissman had the institutional backing

## Snapshots of the true timeline: 2005

Publication of seminal paper [@kariko2005] showing that nucleoside-modified mRNA
avoid stimulating the immune system.

. . .

Motivated by clear reasoning based on **analogy**:

> DNA and RNA stimulate the mammalian innate immune system... DNA containing
> methylated CpG motifs, however, is not stimulatory...
>
> Despite the fact that the immune stimulatory activity of RNA was discovered
> decades before such was identified for DNA and that RNA contains numerous
> modified nucleosides, the effect of nucleoside modifications on RNA immunity
> has not been explored. From the standpoint of immune activation, RNA and DNA
> share many characteristics.

<!-- We have shown that RNA, similarly to DNA, is more immunogenic when derived
from bacteria than from mammalian cells. -->

## Snapshots of the true timeline: 2010

Karikó and Weissman identify the **cellular mechanism** [@anderson2010]:

> Previous studies have shown that the translation level of in vitro transcribed
> messenger RNA (mRNA) is enhanced when its uridines are replaced with
> pseudouridines; however, the reason for this enhancement has not been
> identified. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro transcripts containing uridine
> activate RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which then phosphorylates
> translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF-2α), and inhibits translation.

. . .

At around this time, the idea is picked up Derrick Rossi [@warren2010], who goes
on to co-found Moderna ("modified RNA").

## Looking back from 2023

What can we learn from this story? Hindsight is 20/20, but it sure looks like

- funding and positions were misallocated
- unfounded preconceived ideas about mRNA inhibited progress
- the happy outcome was not inevitable---we're lucky it happened at all

Bias and discrimination may have also played a role.

. . .

Yet this is still a success story. **What about all the missed opportunities
we'll never know about?**

- true opportunity cost is unknowable, but is likely very large
- accelerating science is a complex sociotechnical problem
- far from being monocausal

# The illegibility of science

The outsider's view of science is that it is neat and orderly, but it is not so:

- countless individuals and labs pursue loosely connected research agendas
- it's difficult to know what's going on in your field, let alone others
- exacerbated by
  - growth of scientitic literature
  - displinary boundaries
  - increasing specialization

Obtaining any high level view or synthesis is very difficult.

## Question for funders: what should I fund?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Case: modified RNA

@kariko2005 laid out a clear argument by analogy:

1. DNA and RNA both stimulate immune responses
2. DNA is known to be modifiable to suppress this response
3. DNA and RNA share many characteristics relevant to immune activation
4. Therefore, it is plausible that RNA can also be so modified
:::

. . .

So why was it so hard to get the work funded? Some guesses:

- **Unfamiliarity**: it was perceived as too fringe/unorthodox
- **Risk**: it was perceived as too risky/unlikey to succeed
- **Bias**: the people proposing it were judged inadequate

People fall back on heuristics when the science seems unclear.

## Question for scientists: what should I study?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Case: modified RNA

@kariko2005 was mostly ignored by other scientists for at least five years, despite

- having fairly obvious potential for therapeutic use
- which was immediately recognized by its authors
:::

. . .

Why? The obvious explanation: nobody heard about it!

- it was published in an obscure journal
- by authors who were themselves not widely recognized
- on a topic outside the mainstream

Hence, it was not read.

## Growth of scientific production

![Source: @fortunato2018](figures/fortunato2018_fig1.svg){width=100%}

- Long trend of exponential growth in scientific literature
- @fortunato2018 estimate doubling period of 15 years
- @bornmann2021 estimate
  - overall growth rate of 4.1% $\leftrightarrow$ doubling period of 17.3 years

## Decline of disruptive science?

:::: {.columns}

to be declining.

# Making science legible

The growth of science, both in substance and in volume, creates a pressing
need to make science more *legible*:

- Can policymakers get an accurate picture of state of knowledge in an area?
- Can scientists synthesize what is known in their field?
- Can they make new connections in and between fields?

Moreover, how can this be made *scalable*?

## What of science is supposed to be legible?

In science there is...

1. a core comprising the "logic of science"
   - of which some parts make contact with empirical data
   - of which others serve a theoretical or organizational role
2. much else that serves no logical role but is nonetheless meaningful:
   - motivations, hunches, intuitions, aesthetic judgments, etc

. . .

Scientific core should admit a precise and communicable reconstruction, but

- what aspects belong to this core?
- how can they be recorded and systematized?
- failed attempts at rationalization can be useless or even harmful

## Present state of scientific communication

Science still follows the model pioneered by the Royal Society:

- Results disseminated through scientific papers, published in journals
- Now online but in formats (PDF or HTML) emulating print
- Almost entirely unstructured

One notable improvement: more data and code is being shared.

. . .

Hence, *the large-scale structure of science is illegible.* Possible paths
forward:

1. Extract more from existing written and code artifacts
2. Create new modalities for scientific communication

## Role of AI in science

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

Can AI trawl the literature to synthesize and make new connections?

- Perhaps, but in a limited capacity and as a complement to humans
- Facts, details, and reasoning are essential to science, but are a weakness for
  AI/ML
- AI/ML can be useful for information retrieval and summarization
  (though bias is a risk)

## Changing the medium

I argue that:

1. the scientific core should be precise, or admit a precise reconstruction
2. the medium of scientific communication should be reinvented to allow greater
   precision

Reflects the twin goals

1. to take steps toward a large-scale, integrative logic of science
2. to make content of science more legible to human and artificial agents

**Note**: the word "precise" does not imply any of
"objective," "rational," "universal," "quantitative."

# Paths to legibility

- Many have aspired to these goals but successes have been limited
- What goes wrong? 
- And how we can avoid those mistakes?

## The Semantic Web

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Largest effort to formalize science based on Semantic Web (RDF/OWL)
- Semantic Web aims to offer universal language
- Most ontologies in biomedicine now use Semantic Web
- But, despite huge efforts, adoption and impact have been limited

:::
::: {.column width=50%}

> The essential property of the World Wide Web is its universality...
>
> The Semantic Web, in naming every concept simply by a URI, lets anyone express
> new concepts that they invent with minimal effort. Its unifying logical
> language will enable these concepts to be progressively linked into a
> universal Web.

--- @berners-lee2001

## Searching for a universal language

Semantic Web founders by trying to be universal:

- Description logics like OWL good for containment/subsumption hierarchies
- Hence relative success in certain biomedical domains
- Other kinds of knowledge must be encoded in arbitrary, ad hoc ways

. . .

A common trap:

- Philosophers of science tried to encode scientific theories and models in
  first-order logic and/or set theory
- Nowadays people are advocating for type theory

More expressive languages, but rooted in the same fallacy.

## Domain-specific languages

Scientists want

- to express themselves in languages that make sense to them
- tools that make them more, not less, productive

A few very successful examples of DSLs:

- Computation graph frameworks like PyTorch in machine learning
- Probabilistic programming languages like Stan in statistics

. . .

But DSLs lead to fragmentation, impeding communication between fields.

reproducibility* as enabler of AI progress
:::

## The language dilemma

1. **Universal languages** are expressive but are
   - too low level
   - not usable
   - require ad hoc encodings---hence are not legible

2. **Domain-specific languages** are useful and usable, but
   - proliferate and fragment
   - do not interoprate
   - promote legibility only at small scales

# Structural approach to networked science

- The dilemma presented is a false one
- The structuralism of category theory provides the way out

## Structuralism in mathematics and beyond

> The theme of mathematical structuralism is that what matters to a mathematical
> theory is not the internal nature of its objects, such as its numbers,
> functions, sets, or points, but how those objects relate to each other.
> (Shapiro, [IEP](https://iep.utm.edu/m-struct/))

. . .

- Much of 20^th^ century mathematics developed following this principle
- Category theory then codified it
- We seek to build scientific modeling and publishing tools around it
  1. *At a small scale*: scientific models in the same language form a network,
     connected by their morphisms
  2. *At a large scale*: functorial passages between different modeling
     languages

## Categories of models

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

**Object-centric view** of scientific KR today:

- is largely about naming things
  - controlled vocabularies
  - unique resource identifiers (URIs)
- names are necessary, but
  - they don't give meaning
  - they're never really canonical

:::
::: {.column width=50%}

**Morphism-centric view** of categorical scientific KR:

- Models gain formal meaning from morphisms between them
- Models are "the same" when they are isomorphic
- Similar models are related by (noninvertible) morphisms

:::
::::

## Categories of modeling languages

Shifting levels, modeling languages are categories and hence are

- objects of (higher-dimensional) categories
- with morphisms giving passages between them

::: {.callout-tip}
## Example: compartmental modeling frameworks

Categories of

- Petri nets (with mass-action kinetics)
- Stock and flow diagrams
- Signed graphs/regulatory networks (with Lotka-Volterra dynamics)

all have functorial semantics in ODEs, hence are interoperable.

They also admit functors between each other.

# Thanks!

- This tech talk has focused on framing a problem
- Execution strategy and technical details are also important
- We have already made progress through AlgebraicJulia project
- But we could be more deliberate and strategic
