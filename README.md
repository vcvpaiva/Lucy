# Category Theory Glossary
The work here is based on the corpora: 
1.  abstracts from the journal TAC (Theory and Applications of Categories),  from 1995 up to around Dec 2020. We have 755 abstracts. This corpus is described in https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus/.
2. sentences extracted from the ProofNet project
3. sentences from nLab
(4. sentences from the Chicago notes, are kept in a different repository)

For TAC: the file tac-clean.conll contains an automatically annotated version of the corpus, with dependency structures and POS tags, obtained via spacy. 
The file tac-manual.conllu has an improved version, with manual cleaning of latex, to be described.
