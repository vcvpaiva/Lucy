# Category Theory Glossary
The work here is based on the corpora: 
1.  abstracts from the journal TAC (Theory and Applications of Categories),  from 1995 up to around Dec 2020. We have 755 abstracts. This corpus is described in https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus/.
2. sentences extracted from the ProofNet project (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12433)
3. sentences from nLab
4. (sentences from the Chicago notes, are kept in a different repository)

For TAC: the file tac-clean.conll contains an automatically annotated version of the corpus, with dependency structures and POS tags, obtained via spacy. 
The file tac-manual.conllu has an improved version, with manual cleaning of latex, to be described.

The development version of the glossary was on the Definitions in Math (DefsMath) project page.

The project changed to MathGloss and can be seen at https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/database
