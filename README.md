The work here is based on a corpus of  abstracts from the journal TAC (Theory and Applications of Categories),  from 1995 up to around Dec 2020. We have 755 abstracts.
This corpus is described in
https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus/.

The file tac-clean.conll contains an automatically annotated version of the corpus, with dependency structures and POS tags, obtained via spacy. 
The file tac-manual.conllu has an improved version, with manual corrections to be described.
