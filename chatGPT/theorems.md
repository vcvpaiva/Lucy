Excellent idea! Adding the **mathematical area** will make the glossary much more useful. I’ll structure each entry like this:

**Name**
*One-sentence definition/statement.*
Mathematical area: *X*
Wikidata ID: *Q…*

Here’s the **first batch (10/55)** with areas included:

**Adjoint functors**
A pair of functors $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and $G : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ are adjoint if there is a natural isomorphism $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(F(X),Y) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,G(Y))$.
