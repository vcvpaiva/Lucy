Yes, I can help extend your **MathGloss** with entries modeled in the same style. You gave the pattern:

> *A group GG is abelian if its operation is commutative.
> Wikidata ID: Q181296*

So each entry should have:

1. **A short mathematical definition in natural language**.
2. **The corresponding Wikidata ID**.

Here are entries for the three concepts you mentioned:

---

**Derivative**
The derivative of a function measures how the function’s output value changes with respect to small changes in its input; it represents the instantaneous rate of change or the slope of the tangent line at a point.

Perfect — thanks for the list! This is an excellent sample spanning logic, algebra, geometry, topology, probability, and analysis.

Here’s what I propose: I’ll generate **MathGloss-style entries** for these terms in batches, each entry containing:

* A short, crisp mathematical definition.
* Its **Wikidata ID**.

Here’s the **first batch** (10 entries to check the format):
