Yes, I can help extend your **MathGloss** with entries modeled in the same style. You gave the pattern:

> *A group GG is abelian if its operation is commutative.
> Wikidata ID: Q181296*

So each entry should have:

1. **A short mathematical definition in natural language**.
2. **The corresponding Wikidata ID**.

Here are entries for the three concepts you mentioned:

---

**Derivative**
The derivative of a function measures how the function’s output value changes with respect to small changes in its input; it represents the instantaneous rate of change or the slope of the tangent line at a point.
Wikidata ID: Q29175

---

**Euclidean space**
A Euclidean space is a finite-dimensional space equipped with the structure of Euclidean geometry, typically $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard inner product, where distances and angles can be measured.
Wikidata ID: Q44481

---

**Least common multiple (LCM)**
The least common multiple of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.
Wikidata ID: Q102761

Perfect — thanks for the list! This is an excellent sample spanning logic, algebra, geometry, topology, probability, and analysis.

Here’s what I propose: I’ll generate **MathGloss-style entries** for these terms in batches, each entry containing:

* A short, crisp mathematical definition.
* Its **Wikidata ID**.

Here’s the **first batch** (10 entries to check the format):

---

Would you like me to **continue generating the rest in 10–15 entry batches**, so you can review and refine definitions before we finalize the whole list?

Great! Here’s the **next batch of 15 MathGloss entries**:

---
